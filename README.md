#### NOTICE:  The application although were completely designed by Z0M8I3D aka DigiMancer3D, Grok 3 (xAI) wrote the inital code, edited code while guided by the designer.

###### PERSONAL NOTE FROM DESIGNER:  I don't know C specifically, and the last time I wrote C++ (non-strict code style) was in like 2012 but last time I wrote serious C++ code was 2007/2008. So, Grok was used to transmute JS -> C (strict) then coached for changes there after.  I am personally using this project to learn C and have helped with visuals and that is probably why the UI score still overflow the wrong way and other little messed up details in this game suite.
